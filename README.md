# uhs.life
A modern and reliable platform for information sharing at Unionville High School.
## Our Vision
To build a stronger community at Unionville High School by making information universally accessible on a reliable platform.
## How did we build this?
As our first project on Node.js based platform, we decided to use the Meteor framework in order to streamline the process of development. This means the majority of the app infrastructure is powered by the a suite of tools that came with Meteor; the front-end is mostly based on blaze.js and jQuery, the back-end is based on a publish-subscribe system using nodejs + websockets. The database is mongoDB.
## Limitations During Development
Our team encountered many problems during the development, including but not limited to:
1. Timing of Async Request Calls
2. Deprecated libraries
3. jQuery
4. Deployment issues
5. Codebase restructuring
